Since this was the first time I had ever used Audacity, I wanted to create a simpler scene. My audio narrative consisted of a first date, which I am sure many of us have the experience of. The first date usually goes with introductions, such as where do you work? What do you like to do? These questions are ones I incorporated between my characters, establishing some sense of background to them. In addition to this, first dates can happen at many different places, but more often than not, they happen in a restaurant. This restaurant atmosphere can be identified with the classical piano music playing in the background of the conversation, as well as the sound of the waiter pouring water into their glasses. Through these sounds, I was able to develop the story into one where the characters had discovered they actually knew each other as children. I think this was a surprise ending to the audio narrative, as you cannot tell where it is going to go in the beginning. 

In terms of meeting the baseline criteria for this assignment, I believe that I have included every aspect. The first one was ensuring the audio was between 2-4 minutes, in which mine was about 3 minutes and 40 seconds, staying within the recommended time. In addition to this, I had something change from the beginning to the end of the piece, which would be the terms in which each character new each other. In the beginning, the characters were strangers, but within the 4 minutes, they had discovered their shared childhood photograph. The sounds for the characters, water pouring, and bag rustling were all original sounds recorded by myself. In terms of the other sounds, they were all obtained through CC on freesound.org. I was able to establish permission of using these sounds by messaging or commenting on the author’s original audio, thanking them for permission to use the sound in my project. These sources were then all uploaded in an asset list within my repository, with the appropriate links and information for another user to find the original source. Within the audio, I have layered three or more tracks at once, with the classical and talking sounds in the back, the woman character talking, and the bag rustling as one example. In addition to this, I believe everything has been turned in on the deadlines, as directed. Lastly, for the baseline criteria, I used the auto duck affect to affect the fading in and out of the background noise while my characters engaged in conversation. 

In terms of aspirational inspirations, I feel as though I used audacity effects that were new to me, especially when Ben was able to introduce me to auto duck for my background noise. I had never used audacity before, so virtually any effect I used was new. I also used other effects like the compressor to edit the sound of the woman’s voice. In addition to this, I was able to use the left location filter for the sound of the glass pouring and the right location filter when the woman was looking around in her bag to provide a sense of direction for the listener.

After editing the man and woman’s voices, I was able to merge them, in the sound clip ‘mix’ where it is as though they are together in one room, since they were recorded separately.

Here is a screenshot of my first draft preview, when I had not yet combined the background noise, but rather had the clips separate so I could edit them to be the same length throughout the audio.

Here is a screenshot of some advice I was given to improve my audio narrative. I took the advice of fading in and fading out the music so that the characters’ conversation would be clearer and easier to hear when listening. Additionally, this really gave me the opportunity to adjust the volume of the music because the audio was able to focus more on the conversation.
